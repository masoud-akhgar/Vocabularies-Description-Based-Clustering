Model-based collaborative filtering system
Recommend items to users based on "purchase history" and "similarity" of ratings provided
by other users who bought items to that of a particular customer.


The product recommendations can be based on textual clustering analysis given in product
description.

*Feature extraction from product descriptions:
 - Converting the text in product description into numerical data for analysis:

donot forget preprocesing:
- remove additional words and unrelated
- check word by word
- use description and clean tag, remove_html_tag,split number from word,... : https://www.kaggle.com/lthhngthm/hdp-search-relevance In[29]

idea 1 : use vector like the link(TfidfVectorizer used TF-IDF algorithm)
idea 2 : use code characters ( hard for test)
idea 3 : convert to english letters
idea 4 : study papers
idea 5 : use textdistance(just compare appearantly two strings)

try 1 : CNN for pictures be converted
try 2 : any classifications like k-means(is best when your dataset is big!(test it with descriptions))


DB:
refrence id = school id


K in k-means:
If we increase the number of clusters, the computation cost will also increase. So, if you do not have high computational resources, my advice is to choose a lesser number of clusters
